Certainly! Below is the Ansible playbook that logs the information of the incident involving the successful creation by the user `xgzswexqyk7r`:


- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Log incident information
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "User xgzswexqyk7r successfully created a new incident!"


You can save this playbook in a file, such as `log_incident.yaml`, and then run it using the `ansible-playbook` command.
