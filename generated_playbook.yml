Here's a sample Ansible playbook to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:


---
- name: Fix Apache HTTPD service issue on host 192.168.1.100
  hosts: 192.168.1.100
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
  - name: Check if httpd service is running
    service_facts:
      filter: 'httpd'
    register: httpd_status

  - name: Check if port 80 is accessible
    uri:
      url: "http://{{ inventory_hostname }}:80"
      method: GET
      status_code: 200
      return_content: yes
    register: port_80_accessible
    failed_when: "'status' in port_80_accessible and port_80_accessible.status == 404"

  - name: Start httpd service if it's not running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
    when: httpd_status.httpd.state != 'running'

  - name: Enable httpd service on boot
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: enabled
    when: httpd_status.httpd.state != 'enabled'

  - name: Restart httpd service if it was already running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted

  - name: Check if port 80 is accessible after restarting the service
    uri:
      url: "http://{{ inventory_hostname }}:80"
      method: GET
      status_code: 200
      return_content: yes
    register: port_80_accessible_after_restart
    failed_when: "'status' in port_80_accessible_after_restart and port_80_accessible_after_restart.status == 404"

  - name: Check if the issue is resolved
    debug:
      msg: "Issue resolved"
    when: not port_80_accessible.failed

  - name: Check for any errors during the troubleshooting process
    assert:
      that: "'status' in port_80_accessible_after_restart and port_80_accessible_after_restart.status == 200"


This playbook performs the following tasks:

1. Checks if the `httpd` service is running on the target host.
2. Tries to access port 80 of the target host using a GET request, checking for a successful response (HTTP status code 200).
3. If the `httpd` service is not running, starts it and enables it to start at boot time.
4. Restarts the `httpd` service if it was already running before.
5. Checks again if port 80 is accessible after restarting the service.
6. Finally checks for any errors during the troubleshooting process.

This playbook assumes that you have Ansible installed on your machine, and you're running it from a directory containing this YAML file.
