Here's a sample Ansible playbook to troubleshoot the issue:

**playbook.yml**

---
- name: Troubleshoot HTTPD service on host 192.168.1.100
  hosts: 192.168.1.100
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Check if httpd is running
      service_facts:
        name: httpd
      register: httpd_status

    - name: Check if port 80 is accessible
      uri:
        url: "http://{{ inventory_hostname }}:80"
        return_content: yes
      register: port_80_accessible

    - name: Report on service status and accessibility of port 80
      debug:
        var: httpd_status | combine(port_80_accessible._content)

    - name: Start the httpd service if it's not running
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Restart the network service to ensure changes take effect
      service:
        name: network
        state: restarted

This playbook uses Ansible's built-in modules to:

1. Gather facts about the `httpd` service.
2. Check if port 80 is accessible using a simple HTTP request.
3. Report on both the service status and accessibility of port 80.
4. If necessary, start the `httpd` service and enable it for future boots.
5. Restart the network service to ensure any changes take effect.

You can run this playbook by executing `ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml` (assuming you have a file named `hosts` containing the IP address of the host) or with other options as needed.
