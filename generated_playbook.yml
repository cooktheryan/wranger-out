Here's a well-documented Ansible playbook to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

**playbook.yml**

---
- name: Troubleshoot and Fix HTTPD Service on Host 192.168.1.100
  hosts: 192.168.1.100
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Check if httpd service is running
      service_facts:
        name: httpd
      register: httpd_status

    - name: Debug httpd status
      debug:
        var=httpd_status

    - name: Restart httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted

    - name: Check if port 80 is accessible
      uri:
        url: http://192.168.1.100/
        method: GET
      register: port_80_status

    - name: Debug port 80 status
      debug:
        var=port_80_status

    - name: Reload firewall rules to allow incoming traffic on port 80
      firewalld:
        service: http
        permanent: yes
        state: enabled

This playbook performs the following tasks:

1. Checks if the `httpd` service is running using `service_facts`.
2. Displays the status of the `httpd` service for debugging purposes.
3. Restarts the `httpd` service to ensure it's running correctly.
4. Checks if port 80 is accessible by sending a GET request to `http://192.168.1.100/`.
5. Displays the result of the port 80 check for debugging purposes.
6. Reloads the firewall rules to allow incoming traffic on port 80.

**Run the playbook**

To run this playbook, navigate to the directory containing the `playbook.yml` file and execute the following command:

Replace `hosts` with your inventory file if it's not named as `hosts`.
