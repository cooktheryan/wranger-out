Here's a sample Ansible playbook to check the status of Apache HTTP Server (httpd) service on host 192.168.1.100, start it if necessary, and ensure port 80 is open:

**incident_response.yml**

---
- name: Respond to incident report - httpd stopped and port 80 inaccessible
  hosts: 192.168.1.100

  tasks:
  - name: Check status of Apache HTTP Server service
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
    register: httpd_status

  - name: Ensure port 80 is open
    ufw:
      rule: allow
      proto: tcp
      port: 80

  - name: Check if port 80 is accessible
    uri:
      url: http://localhost/
      status_code: 200
    register: httpd_accessible

  - name: Start Apache HTTP Server service if necessary
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
      enabled: yes
    when: httpd_status.state != 'running'

  - name: Restart Apache HTTP Server service to ensure port 80 is accessible
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
    when: httpd_accessible is defined and httpd_accessible.status_code == 500

  - name: Check if port 80 is still inaccessible (should not be the case after restart)
    uri:
      url: http://localhost/
      status_code: 200
    register: httpd_accessible_after_restart

This playbook performs the following:

1. Checks the status of Apache HTTP Server service on the host.
2. Ensures that port 80 is open using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall).
3. Verifies if port 80 is accessible by making a GET request to `http://localhost/`.
4. Starts the Apache HTTP Server service if it's not running.
5. If the previous step fails and port 80 remains inaccessible, restarts the Apache HTTP Server service to ensure it's up and running correctly.
6. Performs another check to verify that port 80 is accessible after restarting the service.

You can run this playbook using Ansible: `ansible-playbook -i hosts incident_response.yml`
