Sure, here is an Ansible playbook that restarts the `httpd` service on the server with the IP address `192.168.1.133`:


---
- name: Restart httpd service
  hosts: 192.168.1.133
  tasks:
    - name: Restart httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted


You can save this playbook to a file, for example, `restart_httpd.yaml`, and run it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

bash
ansible-playbook restart_httpd.yaml
